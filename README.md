HTML CSS NFT SITE static

demo: https://michaljakubhoppe.github.io/NFT-website-static/

What Ive learnt:
adding  semantic HTML to make the site more accessible,

improving user experience by putting hover and active states on the links,

styling up links to have dotted underline or remove underline altogether,

styling some of the links to become buttons-choosing the right elements for navigation and interaction,

specificity, 

deciding when to group or use two classes selectors,

block, inline, inline-block elements.
